# [Experimental Combat Snapshot]()     
### Minecraft: Java Edition - Data Pack  

### *Hunger system from jeb_'s experimetnal combat snapshots!*   

I will add the sprinting mechanic to this if I can, but this is mostly just something to get close to the combat snapshot in functionality.   
I think all of us are tired of health not regenerating after 1.5 nuggets deplete.    
`Your health will now replenish until you have 3 nuggets left.` (6 Points)  

   Commands:   
`/trigger combsnap` - sends the player a random message     
   OPs can use theese commands:   
`/function combsnap:config` - to configure the data pack  
`/function combsnap:uninstall` - to uninstall all releavent scorebaords/tags.
