# [Experimental Combat Snapshot]()     
### Minecraft: Java Edition - Data Pack  

### *Hunger system from jeb_'s experimetnal combat snapshots!*   

I think all of us are tired of health not regenerating after 1.5 nuggets deplete.    
`Your health will now replenish until you have 3 nuggets left.` (6 Points)  
Sprinting below 3 nuggtes! (you will get speed 2 when your hunger falls below 6 points, workaround since sprint is locked)   

   Commands:   
`/trigger combsnap` - toggle combat snapshot (per player)     
   OPs can use theese commands:   
`/function combsnap:config` - to configure the data pack  
`/function combsnap:uninstall` - to uninstall all releavent scorebaords/tags.
