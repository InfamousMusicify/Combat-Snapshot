# [Experimental Combat Snapshot](https://github.com/InfamousMusicify/Combat-Snapshot/releases/)     
### Minecraft: Java Edition - Data Pack  

### *Datapack Version of jeb_'s experimetnal combat snapshots!*   

I think all of us are tired of health not regenerating after 1.5 nuggets deplete.    
`Your health will now replenish until you have 3 nuggets left.` (6 Points)    
Weapons overall are weaker.    
Spam click with less of a penalty!    
Overcharge instead of a cooldown on attacks. gain 200% dmg at full charge.     
Saturation now works as intended. as a pause, instead of more food.      
Hunger depletes slower (1/3 nugget to 1/2 heart)      

Optional in config: -off by default
Sprinting below 3 nuggtes! (you will get speed 2 when your hunger falls below 6 points, workaround since sprint is locked)

   OPs can use theese commands:
