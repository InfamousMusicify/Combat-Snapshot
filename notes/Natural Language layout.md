# Attack speed raised to 25 always, implementing custom system of overcharge.  all weapons undercharged by default.  there is no more cooldown, just a minor penalty if you dont let overcharge engage
# attack indicator is not something i can tweak.  look for non invase alternative to display the recharge info to the player.

# While holding nothing (or a random item)  the player will have base attack dmg of 1
# While holding a weapon of some sort player attack dmg will be 0, unless jeb states otherwise. axes may need special treatment.

# overcharge will raise attack dmg to 1
# if the axe has cleaving raise attack dmg to 2

# missing may be tricky to implement properly if full attack speed is being used.
# there is no way i can find off the top of my head to detect players swinging a weapon in particular in the air.  it detects block breaks and mob hits.  so its easy to implement jebs spam click or only fire charged attacks when hit.
# maybe, set to 8 by default, if player hits set attack speed to 25.


# there are predicates to detect if a player is hold a sword or axe, also with tags.



# next things i want to do
# Trident return from void with loyalty
