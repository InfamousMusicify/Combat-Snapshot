#            reddit 1:
major changes:
*    Overall much faster attacks
*    Attacks only happen when fully charged, even if you spam click
*    Weapons have different reach (attack range)
*    When you stop attacking, the attack timer will continue charging to 200%
*    At 200% you can perform special attacks (crits, sweeping, knockback) and these attacks have longer reach

#            Reddit 2:
 These are the edits in this version:
*    Decreased attack speed of swords
Some clarifications:
*    Weapon reach is always active (not only for special attacks), but during special attacks the reach is increased by an additional half a block

#            Reddit 3:
 I went through the comments on the previous post and the topics on the feedback site, and made a couple of changes:
*    Returned Sword speed to 3.0 (from 2.5)
*    Axes now only take 1 durability damage for attacking
*    Axes now have a new "Chopping" enchantment that adds +1 damage and +.5s shield stun per level (max 3 levels)
#    Added an option to hide the shield when it's active
Additional notes:
* The Chopping enchantment is experimental. You can still apply Sharpness to axes in the anvil, but Sharpness and Chopping are mutually exclusive. An option here is to change Chopping so that it only affects shields, and let axes get Sharpness from enchanting, but currently there are no mobs in the game that use shields so in that case Chopping would be meaningless in PvE.

#            Reddit 4:
First of all, some basic combat changes:
*    The attack timer now only resets when you actually perform an attack (it's unaffected by switching items)
*    Critical attacks (jump-attacks) will now trigger at 100% (no need to wait)
*    Default attack reach has been decreased by 0.5 (to 2.5 blocks)
*    The full timer ("200%") attack now has +1.0 reach (was 0.5)
Some shield changes:
#    Removed the option to hide the shield
Some trident parity changes:
*    Tridents with Loyalty that fall into the void will return to its owner
*    Tridents with Impaler now deal enchantment damage to all mobs that are in water or rain
Some random snowball changes:
*    Snowballs now stack to 64
Axe enchantments:
*    Chopping hasn't been changed (I point this out because there was a lot of Chopping feedback)

#            Reddit 5:
After a lot of thinking on these problems I decideded to make the following main changes:
*    Make weapons weaker
*    Remove the regeneration boost from food saturation
* In detail, weapons:
    Stone tier lowered to +0 (same as wood, was +1)
    Iron tier lowered to +1 (was +2)
    Diamond tier lowered to +2 (was +3)
    Swords lowered to +2 (was +3)
    Axes lowered to +3 (was +4)
    Trident lowered to 5 (was 6)
For example, a Diamond Sword now deals 2+2+2=6 points of damage. This was 2+3+3=8 in the previous test, and 1+3+3=7 in 1.9/1.8 (base damage is 2 now, same as on Bedrock).
In detail, food rebalance:
*    Saturation boost removed
*    Natural healing works longer (down to 6 food points, used to be down to 18)
*    Natural healing is faster (every 3 seconds, was 4)
*    New: Natural healing now always drains food points. Saturation is not used when healing damage, and is only relevant as a "pause" until food drains (as originally intended)
*    Sprinting is no longer affected by the food value
Other changes:
*    Made it possible to hit players with snowballs (TODO: game rule)
Bonus controversial edit...

#            Reddit 6:
Redesigned aim assist again. Different approach this time, NO LESS CONTROVERSIAL!
*    Missing now only puts a 4 tick delay until the next attack regardless of weapon.
*    Increased base reach to 3 (was 2.5) and removed bonus reach for delayed attacks
Changes to shields:
Changes to axes:
*    Renamed Chopping to Cleaving
*    Removed other weapon enchantments from the enchanting table. The axes simply had too many possible enchantments. It also feels a little bit fitting with a rare Cleaving enchantment than a common Sharpness enchantment for axes
Changes to bows / projectiles:
Changes to food and hunger:
*    Reverted eating time to 32 ticks
*    Natural healing is even faster (2 seconds, was 3 seconds)
*    Natural healing drains food 50% slower
*    By popular request - Reintroduced the rule that sprinting requires more than 6 points of food

#            Reddit 7:
Features that have been changed back:
*    Returned the "200% time" attacks (let's call them "charged" attacks) and the +1 reach bonus
*    Returned base reach to 2.5 blocks
Features that have been adjusted:
*    Missed attacks are still fast, but they don't count as charged. Because of how the programming code is laid out it meant I had to change how the auto-attack "penalty" is applied. Instead of being 20% slower, they add a hard-coded single tick to the attack rate (i.e. after a miss you can optimally attack again after 4 ticks, or after 5 ticks when holding the attack)
*    You won't get the reach bonus while you are crouching (to add a slight disadvantage to shielding and attacking simultaneously)
Bug fixes:
*    Netherite weapons have updated stats

#            Reddit 8:
Balance changes:
*    Weapon enchantments are now included in the base damage when calculating crits and potion effects
*    Strength I/II now adds +20%/+40% (was +3/+6 damage)
*    Healing potions now heal 6 points per level (was 4)
*    Cleaving now adds +2/+3/+4 points of damage (was +1/+2/+3)
*    Liquid food (stews, honey, milk) can now be consumed faster (20 ticks, was 32 or 40 ticks)
*    Potions can now be drunk faster (20 ticks, was 32 ticks)
