Jebs reddit post on snapshot 5:
 After a lot of thinking on these problems I decideded to make the following main changes:
    *Make weapons weaker
    *Remove the regeneration boost from food saturation

In detail, weapons:
    Stone tier lowered to +0 (same as wood, was +1)
    Iron tier lowered to +1 (was +2)
    Diamond tier lowered to +2 (was +3)
    Swords lowered to +2 (was +3)
    Axes lowered to +3 (was +4)
    Trident lowered to 5 (was 6)
For example, a Diamond Sword now deals 2+2+2=6 points of damage. This was 2+3+3=8 in the previous test, and 1+3+3=7 in 1.9/1.8 (base damage is 2 now, same as on Bedrock).

In detail, food rebalance:
    *Saturation boost removed
    #Eating food is now slower (40 ticks, was 32 ticks)
    ^Natural healing works longer (down to 6 food points, used to be down to 18)
    ^Natural healing is faster (every 3 seconds, was 4)
    *New: Natural healing now always drains food points. Saturation is not used when healing damage, and is only relevant as a "pause" until food drains (as originally intended)
    -^Sprinting is no longer affected by the food value

#Other changes:
    #Various block-hitting and air-swinging bug fixes
    #Made it possible to hit players with snowballs (TODO: game rule)
    #Reintroduced upwards knockback when hitting players in the air... Probably too strong right now, but can be balanced later
    #Changed the swing animation to emphasize the rythm of the attacks
    #Added cooldown to egg

Bonus controversial edit...
    -*Added a kind of "Coyote Time" that activates for a fraction of a second if you aim at something but attack outside its bounding box. The background to this change is that since you can't attack between swings, it often gave the impression that your input was "lost". It also made fighting small and fast targets (rabbits or baby zombies) unneccessarily frustrating


# cant do
* research
-* research for fun
^ can and have or will do
-^ can do with caviats
