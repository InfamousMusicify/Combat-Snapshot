The combat mechanics in Java Edition have been a controversial topic ever since the 1.9 update. We want the mechanics to be the same across all editions, but simply porting Java to Bedrock or vice versa is not taking us forward. We want to find a system that is flexible and works well across all input devices. 
 Main issues in Java Edition,
    Too slow for PvP - not exciting enough
    Damage per second is too low to beat regenerating items
    Too hard to understand for new players

Main issues in Bedrock,
    Tedious on controller (Legacy editions fixed this)
    Weapons are very similar
    Armor is not balanced

This "manually installed Java snapshot" is the first experiment of the new direction of combat mechanics. It's based upon the current Java Edition system, but with the following major changes:
    Overall much faster attacks
    Attacks only happen when fully charged, even if you spam click
    You can hold to attack
    Weapons have different reach (attack range)
    When you stop attacking, the attack timer will continue charging to 200%
    At 200% you can perform special attacks (crits, sweeping, knockback) and these attacks have longer reach
    Sweeping only occurs on swords with the Sweeping enchantment
    Critical attacks (jump attacks) bypass shields
    Shields have no warm-up delay
    Shields also activate when crouching/sneaking
    If you hit something, the target's "invulnerability timer" will be shorter if you have a quick weapon

Please comment and critique, and give suggestions on where to go from here.

Hey again! Here's an update on the test snapshots for combat mechanics. It's pretty much the same as the previous test, but there are a number of edits that I'll describe below, and a few clarifications. 
 These are the edits in this version:
    Decreased attack speed of swords
    Attacking while crouching will now disable the shield during the attack
    Shields protect against critical attacks again
    Removed auto-attacking by holding the button
    Fixed creative mode bugs
    Fixed scale of the hotbar attack indicator

Some clarifications:
    The theme of the next major update will be announced at MINECON. These combat tests are done in parallel and will be included when they're good enough (i.e. the next theme is not "combat update")
    Weapon reach is always active (not only for special attacks), but during special attacks the reach is increased by an additional half a block
    Hold to auto-attack will always be enabled for controller and touch

 Please take the time to read the full post, thank you! =)
Alright! Time for the third test snapshot of new combat mechanics! 

 I went through the comments on the previous post and the topics on the feedback site, and made a couple of changes:
    Returned Sword speed to 3.0 (from 2.5)
    Re-introduced hold-to-attack, but attacks now happen at "120%" charge which is slightly slower than optimal spam clicking
    Knockback resistance is now a scale instead of a dice roll (less RNG)
    Axes now always disable shields for 1.6s, instead of a 25% chance to disable them for 5s (less RNG)
    Axes now only take 1 durability damage for attacking
    Axes now have a new "Chopping" enchantment that adds +1 damage and +.5s shield stun per level (max 3 levels)
    Projectiles no longer trigger the invulnerability timer, which means that a Multishot crossbow can hit (and deal damage) with all three arrows
    Shields protective arc has been decreased to ~100 degrees instead of 180 degrees
    Added a "Shield Indicator" option that displays when the shield is active (similar to the attack indicator)
    Added an option to hide the shield when it's active

Additional notes:
The Chopping enchantment is experimental. You can still apply Sharpness to axes in the anvil, but Sharpness and Chopping are mutually exclusive. An option here is to change Chopping so that it only affects shields, and let axes get Sharpness from enchanting, but currently there are no mobs in the game that use shields so in that case Chopping would be meaningless in PvE.
The delay to auto-attacking will likely be removed when we add the system to Bedrock for controllers and touch. It may be a mouse-and-keyboard only limitation. 

#            Reddit 4:
 Happy Thanksgiving! Time for the fourth test snapshot of new combat mechanics! This time the snapshot is based on version 1.15 of Minecraft, but is still not compatible with the 1.15 pre-releases!
I'm very grateful for all feedback and comments. This time I actually made a few dramatic changes that hopefully will allow for a snappier and more varied PvP experience.
Whenever I get the "just revert to 1.8", my eyes roll a full 360 in their sockets... I have to design a system that works well both in PvE and PvP, and well on touch and controller as well as mouse-and-keyboard. It will never be 100% equal for everyone, but I will at least try something that works OK in most scenarios while still giving some design flexibility.
However, it's great when people pinpoint exactly what it is they're missing the most from 1.8 PvP gameplay. Could be w-tapping, item combos, fishing poles, or something else. If you are passionate about a specific detail you should definitely make yourself heard.

First of all, some basic combat changes:
    The attack timer now only resets when you actually perform an attack (it's unaffected by switching items)
    Critical attacks (jump-attacks) will now trigger at 100% (no need to wait)
    Knockback attacks (sprint-attacks) will now trigger at 100%
    Default attack reach has been decreased by 0.5 (to 2.5 blocks)
    The full timer ("200%") attack now has +1.0 reach (was 0.5)
    Arrow accuracy has been increased ("uncertainty" value decreased from 1.0 to 0.25)

Some shield changes:
    Added an option to disable the use-shield-on-crouch (it's in the accessibility menu)
    Removed the option to hide the shield

Some trident parity changes:
    Tridents can be shot from dispensers
    Tridents with Loyalty that fall into the void will return to its owner
    Tridents with Impaler now deal enchantment damage to all mobs that are in water or rain

Some random snowball changes:
    Snowballs now stack to 64
    Snowballs have a 4 tick cooldown
    Snowballs are not rendered the first 2 ticks (hack to prevent screen flickering)

Axe enchantments:
    All damage enchantments can be applied to axes in the enchanting table
    Chopping hasn't been changed (I point this out because there was a lot of Chopping feedback)

#            Reddit 5:
 Hey hey hey!
Here is the fifth version of the combat mechanics tests. The snapshot is based on the 1.15.2 pre-release, but is - as always - not compatible with the main game.
This snapshot contains some rather impactful changes. The reason is that I'm trying to pinpoint the problems of 1.9 PvP while making sure PvE still feels enjoyable. There have been two major - though slightly contradictory - points of feedback.

First, armor is too weak and barely matter. In particular low quality armor. Secondly, 1.9's food regeneration encourages defensive and evasive gameplay. The first problem makes fights too quick, and the second problem makes them drag out and feel boring.

After a lot of thinking on these problems I decideded to make the following main changes:
    Make weapons weaker
    Remove the regeneration boost from food saturation

In detail, weapons:
    Stone tier lowered to +0 (same as wood, was +1)
    Iron tier lowered to +1 (was +2)
    Diamond tier lowered to +2 (was +3)
    Swords lowered to +2 (was +3)
    Axes lowered to +3 (was +4)
    Trident lowered to 5 (was 6)
For example, a Diamond Sword now deals 2+2+2=6 points of damage. This was 2+3+3=8 in the previous test, and 1+3+3=7 in 1.9/1.8 (base damage is 2 now, same as on Bedrock).

In detail, food rebalance:
    Saturation boost removed
    Eating food is now slower (40 ticks, was 32 ticks)
    Natural healing works longer (down to 6 food points, used to be down to 18)
    Natural healing is faster (every 3 seconds, was 4)
    New: Natural healing now always drains food points. Saturation is not used when healing damage, and is only relevant as a "pause" until food drains (as originally intended)
    Sprinting is no longer affected by the food value

Other changes:
    Various block-hitting and air-swinging bug fixes
    Made it possible to hit players with snowballs (TODO: game rule)
    Reintroduced upwards knockback when hitting players in the air... Probably too strong right now, but can be balanced later
    Changed the swing animation to emphasize the rythm of the attacks
    Added cooldown to egg

Bonus controversial edit...
    Added a kind of "Coyote Time" that activates for a fraction of a second if you aim at something but attack outside its bounding box. The background to this change is that since you can't attack between swings, it often gave the impression that your input was "lost". It also made fighting small and fast targets (rabbits or baby zombies) unneccessarily frustrating

Again, thank you all for your input! 

#            Reddit 6:
 Note: This is a test snapshot, not to be confused with the 1.16.2 pre-releases!
After half a year of hiatus, here's version 6 of the combat test snapshots!

Again there are some radical changes, which means we're still not ready to move on to phase 2 of the tests (which means, fewer system changes and more focused on number balancing). If you have a keen eye you will notice that we are slowly progressing more and more towards something similar to 1.8, but recent twitter comments are saying v5 was great, so... I'm trying to find the sweet spot. Remember, squeaky wheel gets the oil!

Changes compared to previous test

Redesigned aim assist again. Different approach this time, NO LESS CONTROVERSIAL!
    Removed "Coyote Time"
    Entities with bounding boxes that are smaller than 0.9 of a block are inflated (for targeting purposes) to be 0.9 of a block (rabbits, bats, etc)
    Swords always have sweeping attacks again, axes have it with the Sweeping enchantment
    Missing now only puts a 4 tick delay until the next attack regardless of weapon.
    Increased base reach to 3 (was 2.5) and removed bonus reach for delayed attacks

Changes to shields:
    Shields now only protect up to 5 damage for melee attacks (still 100% against projectiles)
    Shields recover faster after an attack

Changes to axes:
    Renamed Chopping to Cleaving
    Removed other weapon enchantments from the enchanting table. The axes simply had too many possible enchantments. It also feels a little bit fitting with a rare Cleaving enchantment than a common Sharpness enchantment for axes

Changes to bows / projectiles:
    Player momentum is added to thrown projectiles, but only in the direction you are aiming
    Bow and arrow accuracy now slowly decreases the longer you pull the bow

Changes to food and hunger:
    Reverted eating time to 32 ticks
    Eating is now interrupted if something hits you
    Natural healing is even faster (2 seconds, was 3 seconds)
    Natural healing drains food 50% slower
    By popular request - Reintroduced the rule that sprinting requires more than 6 points of food

Other changes:
    Removed the attack indicator completely since it is no longer used by any systems
    Fixed knockback calculation
    Fixed damage value on items being off-by-one client-side
    Fixed bug that caused players to be unable to attack/interract after respawning
    Nerfed Sweeping Edge enchantment to 25/33/37.5 percent (was 50/66/75%)

Again, thank you all for your input! 

#            Reddit 7:
 Here's combat test snapshot version 7c!

I received some 3000 comments on the last post, and also got help from players testing some PvP changes (hence version "c"), so a number of changes have been reverted back to be more similar to version 5. This is a good thing, because now it feels like we're getting closer to a simple - yet deep and exciting - design for the combat mechanics.

Features that have been changed back:
    Returned the attack indicator
    Returned the "200% time" attacks (let's call them "charged" attacks) and the +1 reach bonus
    Returned sweeping to only work for charged attacks and when having the Sweeping enchantment
    Returned base reach to 2.5 blocks
    Removed the bow inaccuracy for holding too long
    Removed the eating interruption for getting hit

Features that have been adjusted:
    Missed attacks are still fast, but they don't count as charged. Because of how the programming code is laid out it meant I had to change how the auto-attack "penalty" is applied. Instead of being 20% slower, they add a hard-coded single tick to the attack rate (i.e. after a miss you can optimally attack again after 4 ticks, or after 5 ticks when holding the attack)
    Shields now add a 50% knockback resistance when active
    Shields are now always instant
    Shields protect against 100% explosion damage
    You won't get the reach bonus while you are crouching (to add a slight disadvantage to shielding and attacking simultaneously)

Bug fixes:
    Netherite weapons have updated stats
    Using shields while crouching is now no longer desynchronized when attacking air
    Players in spectator mode can no longer sweep in the air
    Knockback attribute no longer have a random chance to completely prevent knockback
    Fixed player speed bug for crouching vs using shield (thanks u/Dual_Iron)

Again, thank you all for your comments and feedback. Special thanks to @CodingCookey and friends for PvP testing!
Please playtest the snapshots and share videos! 

#            Reddit 8:
 Here's combat test snapshot version 8b!

Mostly balance changes this time, I think we're getting somewhere.

Features that have made a return:
    Returned eating interruption for getting hit (by players or mobs), also applies to drinking
    Returned bow fatigue for holding the bow pulled, but it doesn't start until 3 seconds. Bow fatigue will also cancel out "critical arrows"

Balance changes:
    Weapon enchantments are now included in the base damage when calculating crits and potion effects
    Strength I/II now adds +20%/+40% (was +3/+6 damage)
    Instantenous effects on tipped arrows are now scaled by 1/8, just like the duration of other effects
    Healing potions now heal 6 points per level (was 4)
    Cleaving now adds +2/+3/+4 points of damage (was +1/+2/+3)
    Liquid food (stews, honey, milk) can now be consumed faster (20 ticks, was 32 or 40 ticks)
    Potions can now be drunk faster (20 ticks, was 32 ticks)

Bug fixes:
    Fixed shield protection arcs... again!
    Improved server-side attack range calculations, should hopefully mean fewer "false misses" but still needs more work

And as always, thank you all for your comments and feedback.
